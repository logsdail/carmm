'''
A collection of scripts that can generate and manipulate Chemshell fragment and cluster objects. These can be created
from ASE Atoms objects and can use either a large, non-periodic structure to cut out a spherical cluster or can
make a cluster from a periodic model.

def cutout_sphere(atoms, centre, distance_cutoff=5.0):
    '''
    Returns a spherical cutout of a structure
    TODO: This doesn't work with periodic boundary conditions.
    It'd be nice to get that working and update the regression to test this.

    Parameters:

    atoms: Atoms object
        Input structure to cutout from
    centre: Integer
        Index of central atom in cutout
    distance_cutoff: Float
        Distance outside of which atoms are removed
