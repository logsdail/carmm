def dissociation(atoms, i1, i2, step_size=0.05, n_steps=20, final_distance=None, group_move=None, z_bias=False):

    '''
    This function is a tool for investigating bond dissociation.
    Bond length of interest is fixed and is increased by step_size in each iteration.
    This aims to help with obtaining activation energies for surface calculations, e.g. hydrogenation,
    where metastability of optimal starting position is often low and thus hard to obtain.
    Returns a list of Atoms objects with changed positions and constraints applied,
    which can be optimised by the user.

    Args:
        atoms: Atoms object
        i1: int
            Index of atom remaining as part of a molecule
        i2: int
            Index of atom dissociating from molecule
        step_size: float
            Distance moved during dissociation in Angstrom per iteration, not used
            when final_distance is specified.
            If negative value - Association is examined instead
        n_steps: int
            Total number of steps
        final_distance: None/float
            User can specify the final distance, the increments will be then based
            on a fraction of n_steps/final_distance instead of step_size
        group_move: list of integers
            User can specify a list of indices of atoms that need to be moved
            together with atom with index i2, e.g. OH group etc.
        z_bias: boolean of float
            If float - bias z-coord of moving atom to approach set value
            WARNING - If TRUE this will make steps vary from defined step_size!
            Bias to adjust the Z-coordinate of atom/group moving to approach
            the surface in periodic calculations rather than just elongate the
            bond.
