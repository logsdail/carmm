# This functionality will help to generate a bulk model from a slab.

def bulk_identifier(slab, cutoff_distance=10.0):
    """
    Slab models can be generated using various libraries like ASE, pymatgen, atomman, etc. However, it becomes important
    to check how these slab models are generated within various code bases.

    Pymatgen for example generates desired surface facets by transforming the basis vectors of the conventional bulk
    unit cell such that the c-vector of new bulk is normal to the desired surface plane. The basis transformation however
    changes the convergence behavior of the slab models with respect to the thickness of the slab. Hence, a new bulk
    unit cell is necessary, generated for each individual slab model, to make sure that the surface energies are
    calculated using a correct bulk reference.

    This function helps to identify the repeating unit in the z-direction which ultimately represents the
    bulk atoms in a slab structure. This new bulk structure will be consistent with the slab model and the
    computed bulk energy for this structure will help us to obtain surface energies that are convergent with
    increasing slab thickness.

    NOTE: Please use this functionality only if you observe divergent surface energy behaviour using the already
    available total energy of the conventional bulk unit cell.

    Detailed information is available in the following literature article.

    "First-principles calculations of metal surfaces. I. Slab-consistent bulk reference for convergent surface
    properties." Physical Review B 103.19 (2021): 195426.

    How this functionality works:
    1. the difference between the x,y and z coordinates of an atom and its corresponding periodic image will be a linear
    combination of the cell vectors a,b and c.
    2. This idea is extended here in case of a slab model where the linear combination check
    is considered only w.r.t to the a and b vectors

    Args:
    - slab: ASE Atoms object representing the slab structure
    - cutoff_distance: Cutoff distance for identifying neighboring atoms (default is 10.0). This will be used to
     perform further checks on atoms which satisfy the condition of linear combination.

    Returns:
    - ASE Atoms object representing the new bulk structure
