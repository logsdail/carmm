def surface_coordination(atoms, cutoff=None, verbose=True):
    '''
    This function allows to extract the following data from the
    supplied Atoms object in the form of a dictionary:
    Per atom:
    - number of neighbouring atoms of specific chemical symbol

    Per atomic layer (based on tag):
    - average coordination number for all M-M combinations of all chemical species,
        e.g. for CuAu alloy slab an average number of Cu-Cu, Cu-Au, Au-Cu and Au-Au
            bonds with surrounding atoms i.e. Cu-Cu_neighbors_per_layer etc.
    - concentration of atoms per layer


    Parameters:
        atoms: Atoms object
            Surface slab containing tagged atomic layers
            e.g. using carmm.build.neb.symmetry.sort_z
