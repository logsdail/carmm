    Parameters:

        dimensions: Integer
            Determines whether we have a "gas"-phase (0) or "periodic" structure (2 or 3)
        k_grid: List of integers

        xc: String
            XC of choice
        compute_forces: String
            Determines whether forces are enabled ("true") or not enabled ("false").

            Dimensions is _not_ used in this routine, but we make it necessary so
            the passthrough isn't problematic for inexperienced users. See get_aims_calculator()
        port: None or Integer
            The port for connection between FHI-aims and ASE with i-Pi sockets.
            This is fairly arbitrary as long as it doesn't clash with local settings.
            If None an integer between 12345 and 60000 will be picked at random.
        host: String
            Name of host computer for ASE. Necessary for calculations where MPI runs on the compute nodes.
            This is now defaulted to None, and then will self-identify the host name if unidentified.
            Long-term, we should consider removing this variable to insulate the users from having to set it.
        logfile: String
            Location of output from sockets communication.
        check_socket: Boolean
            Whether we want the automatically identify and resolve port clashes.
        verbose: Boolean
            For testing of the interface when searching for empty ports.
        codata_warning: Boolean
            Warn the user about Hartree to eV conversion being performed in ASE rather than FHI-aims.
            ASE uses CODATA 2014 and FHI-aims uses CODATA 2002 which yields energy discrepancies.
