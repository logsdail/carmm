# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: linter-check-python3.8

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    # Only invoke for push to main.
    branches: [ main ]   
  pull_request:
    # Run on all pull requests when updated.

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # This name makes the workflow identifiable in checks
    name: linter-build
    
    # The type of runner that the job will run on

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
