# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: linter-check

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    # Only running on master in case there are direct merges
    branches: [ master ]
    #branches: [ master, ReactAims_documentation, harry_branch, cube_file_read, jack_molecules, ob ]
  pull_request:
    # Run on all pull requests when updated.

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # This name makes the workflow identifiable in checks
    name: linter-build
    
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    # Ensure we are running Python v3.x
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v1
      with:
        # Issues with bdist_wheel on v3.9
        #python-version: '3.x'
        python-version: '3.7'
