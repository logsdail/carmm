# Cardiff Molecular Modelling

General scripts and software for everyday computational chemistry. Folder names are designed to be self explanatory but just in case we have:

**carmm/build** - contains functions to build stuff

**carmm/run** - contains functions to help with runtime

**carmm/analyse** - contains functions for post-processing

**examples** - example usage, for quality assurance tests and user guidance

**examples/notebooks** - some tutorials written in Jupyter notebooks

Insert the carmm subdirectory into your systems PYTHONPATH variable (e.g. ~/.bashrc) and it should automatically pick up the functions in the child folders. 

*Example: export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/this/folder:$PYTHONPATH*
