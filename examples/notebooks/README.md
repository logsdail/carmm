[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/logsdail/carmm/master?filepath=examples%2Fnotebooks)

This is folder with Jupyter notebooks explaining how to use internal and external packages.

If you want to play with the notebooks, run on your local computer with `jupyter notebook` and then selecting the notebook of interest.

(*Note: you might need to install jupyter first with `pip install --user jupyter`*)

Be sure to set the `JUPYTER_PATH` variable in a similar way that `PYTHONPATH` is defined [previously](../../README.md).

*Example: export JUPYTER_PATH=/path/to/carmm/folder:$JUPYTER_PATH*

Alternatively, clicking on the binder link above will take you to a web platform where you can play with the notebooks without installing anything!
