'''
The functionality presented herein shows how to manipulate the ordering of atoms within Atoms objects in the context
of input preparation for nudged elastic band calculations. The initial and final image must have atoms in the correct
order to ensure that interpolation of atomic coordinates works as intended, chemical symbols must also be identical
between pairs of atoms in the initial and final Atoms object.
