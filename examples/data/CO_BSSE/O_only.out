  Presetting      1001 iterations before the initial mixing cycle

  Presetting a factor      1.000 between actual scf density residual

  takes no effect.
 * No s.c.f. convergence criteria (sc_accuracy_*) were provided in control.in.
 * The run will proceed with a reasonable default guess, but please check whether.
 * the s.c.f. cycles seem to take too much or too little time.
  Calculation of forces was not defined in control.in. No forces will be calculated.
  Geometry relaxation not requested: no relaxation will be performed.
 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable
 * scf convergence criteria. However, this led some users to employ criteria
 * that led to extremely long run times, e.g., for simple relaxation.
 * We now preset a default value for sc_accuracy_rho if it is not set.
 * You may still wish to check if this setting is too tight or too loose for your needs.
 * Based on n_atoms and forces and force-correction status, FHI-aims chose sc_accuracy_rho =  0.800000E-05 .

  Partitioning for Hartree potential was not defined. Using partition_type for integrals.

  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Thus, it is a degenerate system
  within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.
  This may not be harmful. However, for some systems (free atoms), a different, non-degenerate
  ground state might exist by using a smaller broadening (see keyword occupation_type).

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :          -2043.220684884 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :          -2043.239967674 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
